            During the peak of COVID-19, I observed and heard common pain points

            Prior to reaching out for interviewees and conducting user
            interviews, I focused on 5 key areas of inquiry:
            <br /><br />
            01 — Compare and contrast the grocery shopping process from before
            versus after the stay-at-home.
            <br /><br />
            02 — Pain points when it comes to finding the exact or similar food
            product they need/want.
            <br /><br />
            03 — Reason/s to go grocery shopping.
            <br /><br />
            04 — Previous and current comments or opinions on how they perceive
            food.
            <br /><br />
            05 — Locations person goes to when grocery shopping and why.

            <br /><br />
            When it came to some specific items - such as the brand name, they
            found those shelf locations to be empty so they had to either settle
            for another ‘lesser’ quality or brand, or aim to retrieve their item
            at another location, which in most cases, ended up not having the
            item available.

            <br /><br />

          This was my first project where I created an entirely new app, without
          redesigning a current one. Definitely ran into many reiterations and
          epiphanies, venturing into a range design possibilities! I really
          aimed to provide an app that could work across generational gaps -
          users who are in college or just got out of college, parents, seniors,
          etc. - in hopes to make this grocery shopping experience accessible
          and inclusive to a range of people.

          Exploring and researching potential ways to check-out and retrieve
          grocery items - drive and pick up, pick up, delivery, etc.

          <p>Backend screens to enable stores to input their own data.</p>
          Stores could update stocks, messages, etc. all through one app -
          mobile or desktop. Explore more how the CMS (content management
          system) would look like for employees.

          <p>Personalization and social connections.</p>
          Allowing customers to personalize their information through account
          settings. A possible feature to include would be a recipe sharing
          forum. This would help add socialization within a time where
          social-distancing has become a norm.
